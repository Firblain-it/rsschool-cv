## Summary
Currently, I am studying programming on my own, namely the front-end direction. I started my journey a little over a year ago and I'm not going to stop. My goal is to become a front-end developer and a real specialist in my field. For this, I study various technologies and consolidate them in practice (small applications, websites, etc.)
